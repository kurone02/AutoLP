        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 hours daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among these time windows. Staff members are scheduled to work different shifts, each covering a certain number of consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Consider a 24-hour fast food restaurant that operates in eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 hours duration. A shift covers three consecutive time windows (9 hours in total).
