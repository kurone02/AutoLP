In addition, since fruit bowls take longer to prepare, at most 30% of their meals should be fruit bowls. If each salad contains 2 units of potassium and each fruit bowl contains 8 units of potassium, how many of each should they prepare for each staff to maximize their potassium intake?",

        "question": "A clothing company can sell their product in two types of stores, a retail store and a factory outlet. A retail store brings in 200 customers every day and requires 6 employees to operate. A factory outlet brings in 80 customers every day and due to the lower traffic and being in more remote areas, requires 4 employees to run. Company executives decided that there must be at least 1200 customers every day, and can make available 50 employees. How should the company distribute their product to the two types of store to reduce the number of stores that must be open?",

Large mobile production units can hold 6 people and takes up 2 parking spots whereas small mobile production units can hold only 2 people and takes up 1 parking spot. Movie stars prefer to have their small mobile production unit to share with a close staff, therefore at least 5 units must be small mobile units. However, due to logistic limitations, large mobile production units are more space efficient per spot, they must make up at least 75% of all vehicles.
