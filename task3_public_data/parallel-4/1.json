        "question": "To protect soil from erosion, some farmers plant winter cover crops such as winter wheat and rye. In addition to conserving soil, cover crops often increase crop yields in the row crops that follow in spring and summer. Suppose that a farmer has 800 acres of land and plans to plant winter wheat and rye. The input cost for 1 acre for each crop is given in the table below along with the cost for machinery and labor. The profit for 1 acre of each crop is also provided. The farmer has budgeted a maximum of $90,000 for input costs and a maximum of $36,000 for labor and machinery. Determine the number of acres of each crop that the farmer should plant to maximize profit. (Assume that all crops will be sold.). What is the maximum profit? If the profit per acre for wheat were $40 and the profit per acre for rye were $45, how many acres of each crop should be planted to maximize profit?\n\nTable (Input Cost, Labor/Machinery Cost, and Profit per Acre for Wheat and Rye):\n| Crop  | Input Cost per Acre | Labor/Machinery Cost per Acre | Profit per Acre (Original) | Profit per Acre (Adjusted) |\n|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Wheat | $90                 | $50                           | $42                         | $40                         |\n| Rye   | $120                | $40                           | $35                         | $45                         |",

With the current labor force, BTD can produce approximately 420 pipe wrenches per month at a cost of $40 per wrench using regular-time production. Additionally, up to 80 wrenches per month can be produced using overtime at a cost of $45 per wrench. Wrenches can also be produced in advance and stored in inventory at a cost of $3 per month per wrench. The monthly demand for wrenches must be met without fail. At the end of December (beginning of January), BTD has an inventory of 10 wrenches. BTD aims to plan its production, including overtime, and inventory for the next 6 months to maximize profit.
