        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 hours daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among these time windows. Staff members are scheduled to work different shifts, each covering a certain number of consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Consider a 24-hour fast food restaurant that operates in eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 hours duration. A shift covers three consecutive time windows (9 hours in total). The following table shows the number of workers required for each time window and the wage rate per 9-hour shift.\n\nTable (Number of workers required and wage rate per shift for a 24-hour fast food restaurant):\n| Time Window     | Shift 1 | Shift 2 | Shift 3 | Shift 4 | Workers Required |\n| --------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- |\n| 6 a.m. - 9 a.m. | X       |         |         | X       | 55               |\n| 9 a.m. - 12 p.m.| X       |         |         |         | 46               |\n| 12 p.m. - 3 p.m.| X       | X       |         |         | 59               |\n| 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. |         | X       |         |         | 23               |\n| 6 p.m. - 9 p.m. |         | X       | X       |         | 60               |\n| 9 p.m. - 12 a.m.|         |         | X       |         | 38               |\n| 12 a.m. - 3 a.m.|         |         | X       | X       | 20               |\n| 3 a.m. - 6 a.m. |         |         |         | X       | 30               |\n| Wage Rate       | $135    | $140    | $190    | $188    |                  |\n\nNote: \"X\" indicates the shifts that cover each time window.

At these prices RFC believes it can sell up to 20 Classic and 25 Modern dressers per week. Each type of dresser is made of oak and covered with a pecan veneer. The wood requirements for each dresser are given in the table. Oak costs $1.50 per square foot, and pecan veneer costs $2 per square foot. The dressers must go through two manufacturing departments: cutting and veneering. The machine hours required for each dresser are also given below. The Oak Dresse size (square foot), Pecan Dresser size (square foot), cutting Time and Veneering Time for Classic and Modern are [90, 50, 1.20, 1.00] and [100, 60, 0.90, 1.20]. RFC has only 40 hours of production time available each week in each department, and it can obtain up to 2000 board feet of oak and 1500 square feet of pecan veneer each week. The cost of operating each manufacturing department is essentially fixed, so RFC would like to maximize its contribution to overhead (revenue minus variable costs).",

        "question": "Chip Green is the head groundskeeper at Birdie Valley Golf Club. For the mix of grass for the golf course, Chip has decided that the best fertilizer would be a 10-8-12 mixture. (Fertilizer is defined by three values: a, b and c where a is the percentage of nitrogen, b is the percentage of phosphorus, and c is the percentage of potash in the fertilizer. The remaining material is inert matter.) Chip can buy a 10-8-12 mix of fertilizer for $21.75 per 100 pounds, but there are other fertilizers on the market at a variety of prices. The chemical content of [nitrogen, phosphorus, potash] and prices are given below. Fertilizer 1: [10,8,12] for $21.75 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 2: [8,11,15] for $23.75 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 3: [12,7,12] for $22.00 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 4: [10,10,10] for $19.50 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 5: [15,10,6] for $18.50 per 100 pounds;. Chip would like to determine whether or not he could buy several fertilizers and mix them together to obtain a 10-8-12 mixture at a lower cost than $21.75 per 100 pounds. Recognizing that it might be impossible to obtain an exact 10-8-12 mix from the fertilizers, Chip is willing to accept chemical percentages of at least the target amounts, but no more than 0.5% above them (so the nitrogen level should be between 10% and 10.5%; the phosphorus level should be between 8% and 8.5%; the potash level should be between 12% and 12.5%).

The owner and operator of the facility is attempting to rectify these shortcomings by augmenting the menu with vegetable side dishes, which he intends to create from white cabbage, carrots, and a stockpile of pickled cucumbers discovered in the cellar. The following table summarizes the numerical data: the prescribed amount of the vitamins and fiber per dish, their content in the foods, and the unit prices of the foods. For example, Carrot Raw contains 35 mg/kg Vitamin A, 60 mg/kg Vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 30 g/kg as the praise is 0.75 and it's required per dish 0.5mg. For White Cabbage, Raw contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 300 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 20 g/kg as the praise is 0.5 and it's required per dish 15mg. For Cucumber, Pickled contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 10 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 10 g/kg as the praise is 0.15 and it's required per dish 4g.

They sell these three items at several local grocery stores, at craft fairs in the region, and at their own Friendly Farm Pumpkin Festival for 2 weeks in October. Their three primary resources are cooking time in their kitchen, their own labor time, and the apples. They have a total of 500 cooking hours available, and it requires 3.5 hours to cook a 10-gallon batch of apple butter, 5.2 hours to cook 10 gallons of applesauce, and 2.8 hours to cook 10 gallons of jelly. A 10-gallon batch of apple butter requires 1.2 hours of labor, a batch of sauce takes 0.8 hour, and a batch of jelly requires 1.5 hours. The Friendly family has 240 hours of labor available during the fall. They produce about 6,500 apples each fall. A batch of apple butter requires 40 apples, a 10-gallon batch of applesauce requires 55 apples, and a batch of jelly requires 20 apples. After the products are canned, a batch of apple butter will generate $190 in sales revenue, a batch of applesauce will generate a sales revenue of $170, and a batch of jelly will generate sales revenue of $155.

        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 h daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete (say, T) time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among time windows. Staff members are scheduled to n different (work) shifts, each covering m(m < T) consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Following is an example of a 24 h fast food restaurant. The daily operation is divided into eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 h duration.
