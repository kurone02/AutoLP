The weekly fixed cost of keeping each warehouse open is $400 for New York, $500 for Los Angeles, $300 for Chicago, and $150 for Atlanta.

        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 hours daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among these time windows. Staff members are scheduled to work different shifts, each covering a certain number of consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Consider a 24-hour fast food restaurant that operates in eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 hours duration. A shift covers three consecutive time windows (9 hours in total). The following table shows the number of workers required for each time window and the wage rate per 9-hour shift.\n\nTable (Number of workers required and wage rate per shift for a 24-hour fast food restaurant):\n| Time Window     | Shift 1 | Shift 2 | Shift 3 | Shift 4 | Workers Required |\n| --------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- |\n| 6 a.m. - 9 a.m. | X       |         |         | X       | 55               |\n| 9 a.m. - 12 p.m.| X       |         |         |         | 46               |\n| 12 p.m. - 3 p.m.| X       | X       |         |         | 59               |\n| 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. |         | X       |         |         | 23               |\n| 6 p.m. - 9 p.m. |         | X       | X       |         | 60               |\n| 9 p.m. - 12 a.m.|         |         | X       |         | 38               |\n| 12 a.m. - 3 a.m.|         |         | X       | X       | 20               |\n| 3 a.m. - 6 a.m. |         |         |         | X       | 30               |\n| Wage Rate       | $135    | $140    | $190    | $188    |                  |\n\nNote: \"X\" indicates the shifts that cover each time window.

The remaining material is inert matter.) Chip can buy a 10-8-12 mix of fertilizer for $21.75 per 100 pounds, but there are other fertilizers on the market at a variety of prices. The chemical content of [nitrogen, phosphorus, potash] and prices are given below. Fertilizer 1: [10,8,12] for $21.75 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 2: [8,11,15] for $23.75 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 3: [12,7,12] for $22.00 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 4: [10,10,10] for $19.50 per 100 pounds; Fertilizer 5: [15,10,6] for $18.50 per 100 pounds;. Chip would like to determine whether or not he could buy several fertilizers and mix them together to obtain a 10-8-12 mixture at a lower cost than $21.75 per 100 pounds. Recognizing that it might be impossible to obtain an exact 10-8-12 mix from the fertilizers, Chip is willing to accept chemical percentages of at least the target amounts, but no more than 0.5% above them (so the nitrogen level should be between 10% and 10.5%; the phosphorus level should be between 8% and 8.5%; the potash level should be between 12% and 12.5%).

The manager believes that as long as a sheep receives the minimum daily amount of each nutrient, it will be healthy and produce a standard amount of wool. The manager wants to raise the sheep at minimum cost. The columns of table are nutrient name, nutrient unit in the three different grains, and Minimum Daily Requirement (unit). The rows = [Nutrient A, 20, 30, 70, 110], [Nutrient B, 10, 10, 0, 18], [Nutrient C, 50, 30, 0, 90], [Nutrient D, 6, 2.5, 10, 14].

        "question": "To protect soil from erosion, some farmers plant winter cover crops such as winter wheat and rye. In addition to conserving soil, cover crops often increase crop yields in the row crops that follow in spring and summer. Suppose that a farmer has 800 acres of land and plans to plant winter wheat and rye. The input cost for I acre for each crop is given in the table along with the cost for machinery and labor. The profit for 1 acre of each crop is given in the last column. Input Cost per Acre, Labor/Machinery Cost per Acre, Profit per Acre. Wheat: [$90, $50, $42], Rye: [$120, $40, $35]. Suppose the farmer has budgeted a maximum of $90,000 for input costs and a maximum of $36,000 for labor and machinery. Determine the number of acres of each crop that the farmer should plant to maximize profit. (Assume that all crops will be sold.). What is the maximum profit? If the profit per acre for wheat were $40 and the profit per acre for rye were $45, how many acres of each crop should be planted to maximize profit?",

        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 h daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete (say, T) time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among time windows. Staff members are scheduled to n different (work) shifts, each covering m(m < T) consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Following is an example of a 24 h fast food restaurant. The daily operation is divided into eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 h duration. A shift covers three consecutive time windows (i.e., 9h), as shown in Table: \nTime Window, Shift 1 2 3 4, \nWorkers Required: \n6 a.m.-9 a.m. Shift 1 and 4, the Required 55; \n9 a.m.-12 noon Shift 1, the Required 46; \n12 noon-3 p.m. Shift 1 and 2, the Required 59; \n3 p.m.-6 p.m. Shift 2, the Required 23; \n6 p.m.-9 p.m. Shift 2 and 3, the Required 60; \n9 p.m.-12 a.m. Shift 3, the Required 38; \n12 a.m.-3 a.m. Shift 3 and 4, the Required 20; \n3 a.m.-6 a.m. Shift 4, the Required 30. \nThe wage rate per 9 h for shift 1, 2, 3, 4: $135, $140, $190, X $188.",
