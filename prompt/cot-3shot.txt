#### Problem ####
A company is organizing a team-building event and needs to assign participants to different activities. They have a total of 100 employees. Activity A requires 5 employees a team, activity B requires 3 employees a team, and activity C requires 7 employees a team. The company has a total of 100 employees available for the event. The company has a limitation on the number of teams in activity B, which cannot exceed 20. The company wants to maximize participation teams and decides to allocate different weights to each activity: activity A has a weight of 3, activity B has a weight of 2, and activity C has a weight of 4. The objective is to maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights.
The number of teams in activity A: ?
The number of teams in activity B: ?
The number of teams in activity C: ?
The total weighted participation: ?
#### Solution ####
Let's think step by step.

We want to maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights. So, we can set up a linear programming problem.

Let's define the variables:

* NumParticipantsA: The number of participants in activities A
* NumParticipantsB: The number of participants in activities B
* NumParticipantsC: The number of participants in activities C

Note that "The objective is to maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights". Therefore, we need to MAXIMIZE the objective function.

Since activity A has a weight of 3, activity B has a weight of 2, and activity C has a weight of 4, the objective function is: 
3 * num_teams_A + 2 * num_teams_B + 4 * num_teams_C

The objective function is subjected to the following constraints:

1. Total participants cannot exceed 100, and Activity A requires 5 employees a team, activity B requires 3 employees a team, and activity C requires 7 employees a team.
5 * num_teams_A + 3 * num_teams_B + 7 * num_teams_C <= 100

2. num_teams_A >= 0

3. num_teams_B >= 0

4. num_teams_C >= 0

5. The company has a limitation on the number of teams in activity B, which cannot exceed 20.
num_teams_B <= 20

Now, we can start solving the problem with python using pulp library
```python
# Import PuLP library
from pulp import *

# Define the decision variables
# number of teams in activity A
num_teams_A = LpVariable("NumTeamsA", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
# number of teams in activity B
num_teams_B = LpVariable("NumTeamsB", lowBound=0, upBound=20, cat='Integer')
# number of teams in activity C
num_teams_C = LpVariable("NumTeamsC", lowBound=0, cat='Integer') 

# Define the question as a maximum or minimum problem
problem = LpProblem("TeamBuildingEvent", LpMaximize)

# Define the objective function
objective = 3 * num_teams_A + 2 * num_teams_B + 4 * num_teams_C
# maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights
problem += objective

# Define the constraints
# the total number of employees is 100
problem += 5 * num_teams_A + 3 * num_teams_B + 7 * num_teams_C <= 100

# Solve the problem
status = problem.solve()

# Output the answer
print("## start solving")
print("The number of teams in activity A:", num_teams_A.value())
print("The number of teams in activity B:", num_teams_B.value())
print("The number of teams in activity C:", num_teams_C.value())
print("The total weighted participation:", objective.value())
print("## end solving")

#### Problem ####
BrightBulb LLC manufactures LED and incandescent bulbs. They have 3 different machines for production.
Each machine has a different production capacity and cost associated with running it per day. The following Table provides details on the capacity (bulbs per day) and cost (cost per day) for each machine.
Table (Capacity and cost for each machine):
| Bulb Type       | Machine 1   | Machine 2   | Machine 3   |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| LED (Capacity)  | 300         | -           | 500         |
| Incandescent (Capacity) | -     | 400         | -           |
| Cost per Day    | $200        | $250        | $350        |
BrightBulb LLC wants to minimize the total cost of producing 5000 LED bulbs and 6000 incandescent bulbs per week.
Machine 1 and Machine 3 are limited to LED bulb production and Machine 2 is limited to incandescent bulb production.
The weekly production target for LED bulbs is at least 5000, and for incandescent bulbs is at least 6000.
Each machine can only operate for a maximum of 5 days a week due to maintenance requirements.
The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 1: ?
The number of incandescent bulbs produced on machine 2: ?
The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 3: ?
The total cost of production: ?
#### Solution ####
Let's think step by step.

This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem to minimize the total cost of producing 5000 LED bulbs and 6000 incandescent bulbs per week.

Let's define the variables:

* num_led_on_machine1: The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 1 per day
* num_led_on_machine3: The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 3 per day
* num_inc_on_machine2: The number of incandescent bulbs produced on machine 2 per day

To derive the objective function, note that 
    - Machine 1 has capacity of 300 with $200 cost
    - Machine 3 has capacity of 500 with $350 cost
    - Machine 2 has capacity of 400 with $250 cost

Therefore, the objective function is to minimize the total cost:

Minimize: objective = 200 / 300 * num_led_on_machine1 + 250 / 400 * num_inc_on_machine2 + 350 / 500 * num_led_on_machine3

Subject to the following constraints:

1. The total number of LED bulbs produced must be at least 5000:
num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 >= 5000

2. The total number of incandescent bulbs produced must be at least 6000:
num_inc_on_machine2 >= 6000

3. Machine 1 and Machine 3 are limited to LED bulb production:
num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 <= 300 * 5 (machine 1 can produce up to 300 bulbs per day, and it's limited to 5 days a week)
num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 <= 500 * 5 (machine 3 can produce up to 500 bulbs per day, and it's limited to 5 days a week)

4. Machine 2 is limited to incandescent bulb production:
num_inc_on_machine2 <= 400 * 5 (machine 2 can produce up to 400 bulbs per day, and it's limited to 5 days a week)

5. Each machine can only operate for a maximum of 5 days a week:
num_led_on_machine1 <= 5
num_led_on_machine3 <= 5
num_inc_on_machine2 <= 5

Now, we can start solving the problem with python using pulp library
```python
# Import PuLP library

# Define the variables
num_led_on_machine1 = LpVariable("NumLEDOnMachine1", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
num_led_on_machine3 = LpVariable("NumLEDOnMachine3", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
num_inc_on_machine2 = LpVariable("NumINCOnMachine2", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')

# Define the objective function
problem = LpProblem("BrightBulbProblem", LpMinimize)
objective = 200 / 300 * num_led_on_machine1 + 250 / 400 * num_inc_on_machine2 + 350 / 500 * num_led_on_machine3
problem += objective

# Define the constraints
problem += num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 >= 5000
problem += num_inc_on_machine2 >= 6000
problem += num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 <= 300 * 5
problem += num_led_on_machine1 + num_led_on_machine3 <= 500 * 5
problem += num_inc_on_machine2 <= 400 * 5
problem += num_led_on_machine1 <= 5
problem += num_led_on_machine3 <= 5
problem += num_inc_on_machine2 <= 5

# Solve the problem
status = problem.solve()

# Output the answer
print("## start solving")
print("The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 1:", value(num_led_on_machine1))
print("The number of incandescent bulbs produced on machine 2:", value(num_inc_on_machine2))
print("The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 3:", value(num_led_on_machine3))
print("The total cost of production:", value(objective))
print("## end solving")

#### Problem ####
IND Foods factory produces basmati rice and bananas. To make one kilogram of basmati rice requires 1.5 hours of human labor, 2 hours of machine work, and 3 hours of resting under the sun. To make one kilogram of bananas requires 2 hours of human labor, 4 hours of machine work, and 1.5 hours of resting under the sun. The factory only has 90 hours of human labor, 150 hours of machine labor, and 70 hours of time under the sun available. The net profit per kilogram of basmati rice is $15 and the net profit per kilogram of bananas is $28. How many kilograms of each should the factory make in order to maximize profit?
The number of kilograms of basmati rice to produce: ?
The number of kilograms of bananas to produce: ?
The maximum profit: ?
#### Solution ####
Let's think step by step.

Define the variables:

* num_rice: The number of kilograms of basmati rice to produce
* num_bananas: The number of kilograms of bananas to produce

Note that they can be a real number, i.e., of Continuous type.

We want to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the profit from producing basmati rice and bananas:

Maximize: 15 * num_rice + 28 * num_bananas

Subject to the following constraints:

1. Human labor: 1.5 * num_rice + 2 * num_bananas <= 90 (hours of human labor available)
2. Machine labor: 2 * num_rice + 4 * num_bananas <= 150 (hours of machine labor available)
3. Resting under the sun: 3 * num_rice + 1.5 * num_bananas <= 70 (hours of time under the sun available)

We can use the PuLP library to solve this problem:

```
from pulp import *

# Define the variables
num_rice = LpVariable("NumRice", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
num_bananas = LpVariable("NumBananas", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

# Define the problem
problem = LpProblem("INDFoodsProblem", LpMaximize)
objective = 15 * num_rice + 28 * num_bananas
problem += objective

# Define the constraints
problem += 1.5 * num_rice + 2 * num_bananas <= 90
problem += 2 * num_rice + 4 * num_bananas <= 150
problem += 3 * num_rice + 1.5 * num_bananas <= 70

# Solve the problem
status = problem.solve()

# Output the answer
print("## start solving")
print("The number of kilograms of basmati rice to produce:", value(num_rice))
print("The number of kilograms of bananas to produce:", value(num_bananas))
print("The maximum profit:", value(objective))
print("## end solving")
```
