#### Problem ####
A company is organizing a team-building event and needs to assign participants to different activities. They have a total of 100 employees. Activity A requires 5 employees, activity B requires 3 employees, and activity C requires 7 employees. The company has a total of 100 employees available for the event. The company has a limitation on the number of participants in activity B, which cannot exceed 20. The company wants to maximize participation and decides to allocate different weights to each activity: activity A has a weight of 3, activity B has a weight of 2, and activity C has a weight of 4. The objective is to maximize the total participation weighted by the assigned weights.

#### Problem ####
BrightBulb LLC manufactures LED and incandescent bulbs. They have 3 different machines for production.
Each machine has a different production capacity and cost associated with running it per day. The following Table provides details on the capacity (bulbs per day) and cost (cost per day) for each machine.
Table (Capacity and cost for each machine):
| Bulb Type       | Machine 1   | Machine 2   | Machine 3   |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| LED (Capacity)  | 300         | -           | 500         |
| Incandescent (Capacity) | -     | 400         | -           |
| Cost per Day    | $200        | $250        | $350        |
BrightBulb LLC wants to minimize the total cost of producing 5000 LED bulbs and 6000 incandescent bulbs per week.
Machine 1 and Machine 3 are limited to LED bulb production and Machine 2 is limited to incandescent bulb production.
The weekly production target for LED bulbs is at least 5000, and for incandescent bulbs is at least 6000.
Each machine can only operate for a maximum of 5 days a week due to maintenance requirements.
The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 1: ?
The number of incandescent bulbs produced on machine 2: ?
The number of LED bulbs produced on machine 3: ?
The total cost of production: ?

```python
# Import PuLP library

#### Problem ####
A bakery produces bread and pastries using two ovens. The bakery operates for 8 hours a day.
The bakery produces different quantities of bread and pastries depending on the oven used. The following table shows the production per hour for each oven.
Table (The number of items produced per hour by each oven):
| Product Type | Oven 1 | Oven 2 |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Bread        | 50     | 40     |
| Pastries     | 30     | 35     |
The profit from each loaf of bread is $0.30, and the profit from each pastry is $0.50. Maximize the total daily profit.
Each oven can operate for a maximum of 8 hours a day.
The demand requires at least 300 loaves of bread and at least 200 pastries per day.
Oven 1 is more efficient for bread and must be used for bread for at least 3 hours each day.
Due to a contract with a local restaurant, the bakery must produce at least twice as many loaves of bread as pastries.
